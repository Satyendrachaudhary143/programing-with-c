# C Programming: Learn and Practice

Welcome to the **C Programming** project!

This repository is a personal journey into learning the C programming language. My name is **Satyendra Chaudhary**, and I am not a professional teacherâ€”I'm a fellow learner exploring C step by step. All the code, explanations, and practice questions here are written by me as I study and practice C programming. If you are also learning C, I hope this resource helps and motivates you!

## Why This Project?
- To document my progress as I learn C programming from the basics.
- To create a collection of solved questions, code examples, and explanations for future reference.
- To help other beginners who want to learn C by sharing my notes and practice problems.

## What You'll Find Here
- **Detailed Explanations:** Each topic or question includes a clear explanation, so even beginners can understand.
- **Practice Problems:** Real C programming questions with step-by-step solutions.
- **Code Examples:** All code is written, tested, and explained by me.
- **Learning by Doing:** The focus is on hands-on practice, not just theory.

## Project Structure
- **practice/**
  - Contains markdown files with questions, answers, and code examples for C programming.
  - Each file is organized by topic or problem, with detailed explanations and code.
- **1 first program c/**
  - Contains my very first C programs and experiments as I started learning.
- *(More folders may be added in the future as new topics and features are included in this project.)*
## How to Use This Repository
- Browse the `practice` folder to find questions and answers on various C programming topics.
- Read the explanations and try to understand the logic behind each solution.
- Copy the code, run it on your own computer, and experiment by changing values or logic.
- Use this as a reference or a practice workbook as you learn C.

## Who Is This For?
- Anyone who is new to C programming and wants to learn by example.
- Self-learners who appreciate step-by-step explanations and practical code.
- Anyone looking for beginner-friendly C programming practice problems.
